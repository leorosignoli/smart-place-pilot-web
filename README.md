# How to run
To run this project you'll need to have installed Docker, Npm and react. 

## Steps
1. Open terminal.
2. Type the following lines of code  
		_docker build -t sample:dev ._

		_docker run -v ${PWD}:/app -v /app/node_modules -p 3001:3000 --rm 
		sample:dev_

When the project finishes executing, it's informed that _Your Network_ has the adress of: _http://172.17.0.1:3000_, 
although it's important to remenber that this is the container's internal adress. Every time a container is lifted, 
Docker gives it an IP, then creates an internal default network, called bridge, because it's the network that allows
internal comunication between containers. The port that was exported to the local machime was **3001** with the 
-p parameter. 
So to access the application you go to: __localhost:3001__

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
